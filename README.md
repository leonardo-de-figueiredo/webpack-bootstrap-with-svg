# Bootstrap w/ Webpack

Include [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com)'s source Sass and individual JavaScript plugins with [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org).

Based on the original version from here: https://github.com/twbs/examples/tree/main/webpack
I just deleted some unnecessary code and added the svg icons in webpack.config.js
## How to use

```sh
npm install
npm start
```
